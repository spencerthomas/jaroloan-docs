# TRID Compliance

JaroLoan is designed to help you maintain TRID (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure) compliance throughout the loan process.

## TRID Overview

### What is TRID?

TRID combines disclosures required by:

- **TILA** - Truth in Lending Act
- **RESPA** - Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act

Into two primary forms:

- **Loan Estimate (LE)** - Replaces GFE and early TIL
- **Closing Disclosure (CD)** - Replaces HUD-1 and final TIL

### Regulatory Authority

Regulated by the CFPB under Regulation Z (TILA) and Regulation X (RESPA).

## Loan Estimate Requirements

### Timing

LE must be delivered within **3 business days** of receiving an application:

- **Application** = 6 pieces of information:
  1. Consumer name
  2. Consumer income
  3. Consumer SSN
  4. Property address
  5. Property value estimate
  6. Loan amount

### Content Requirements

LE must include:

- Loan terms
- Projected payments
- Costs at closing
- Closing costs
- Cash to close
- Comparisons

### Delivery Methods

JaroLoan tracks delivery by method:

| Method | Receipt Date |
|--------|--------------|
| Hand delivery | Same day |
| Email (consent) | Same day |
| Mail | 3 days later |
| Overnight | 1 day later |

## Intent to Proceed

2. **Changed circumstance affecting eligibility**
3. **Borrower-requested changes**

### Calculation

JaroLoan calculates:

## Tolerance Rules

### Zero Tolerance (No Increase)
